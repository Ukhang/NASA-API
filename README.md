# NASA API 🚀 

Get The data from NASA 👨‍💻. You can set the date 📅 as you wish and see what happened in our world on any day.



## Purpose
Basically, I used to go to the NASA site every day to see what happened in our world today, what NASA has discovered. Inspired from there, I created this application to improve React and TypeScript.
